                          SIMON GAME 

With the group, we chose a game for the project called “Simon”. This game is the online 
version of the Simon electronic game with its circular design and its 4 big, illuminated 
buttons: red, green, blue and yellow.
                        What are the rules?
Each player chooses one color lens and will press only that color lens in the game. Press the 
START button. Simon will give the first signal. The player who chose that color repeats the 
signal.
